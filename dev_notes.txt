This file will be unstructured. I will use it to keep a diary of the dev process

Aim today is to get the intial commit from chibicc ported. I think I will have
one directory per revision. I may merge together some commits into a single
directory. This will lead to many versions of the compiler in tree but will mean
that I won't have a hard dependency on git. I'll keep the main code in a single
C file (chibicc splits it out at some point) just for simplicity. With separate
versions in tree I can see the diff between each with the diff utility (which I
may port to JS too). There is method in my madness. I want this to eventually
work on a win32 machine with no dependencies. Initially dev will be done on
Linux.
